# MealApiDemo

## Meal maker (not for commercial use)

Meal Maker is a meal creator tool that will send requests to 'TheMealDB' and respond with the Meal name, image, YouTube link for instructions, a list of ingredients and more.

The functionality is minimal, but as of now users can search by category, name or generate a random meal.

To get started, clone the repo:
```
https://github.com/Cole-Z/MealMakerDemo.git

```

Then CD into the MealApiDemo folder:
```
$ cd MealApiDemo
```

Finally, run dotnet build and run to open the project:
```
dotnet build
```
```
dotnet run
```
